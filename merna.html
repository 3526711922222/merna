<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Introduction: Hi my name is Merna Salim I am a Grade 9 student at St. Edmund Campion Secondary School. Some of my hobbies are volleyball, soccer, softball, hanging with friends, and staying home. Some sports I play are volleyball, soccer, and softball. I also love trying different products on other people and seeing the finished result with all of them together. This image shows a younger me doing my dad's makeup! I have always wanted to do something involving makeup, and here I am now still wanting to do makeup and soon going to be Sephora's best makeup helper/guider
